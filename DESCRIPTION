Description: Tarima and Pavlov (2006) prevents a method of estimating a
    parameter of interest while using information provided from an external source
    such as previous publications. The external information need not be the same
    parameter as the one of interest, as long as the parameter (s) from the external
    information can be calculated using data you have it can be used to decrease the
    variance in estimating your parameter of interest. The paper also describes an
    adaptive method of doing this, which is exactly what is implemented here.
